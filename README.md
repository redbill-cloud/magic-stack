# Redbill Scanner - Magic Stack

## What is Redbill Magic Stack?

Redbill Magic Stack is a straightforward AWS Bill scanner that generates insights into areas where you can start **saving money immediately**. The Magic Stack scans your billing data and notifies the aggregate findings to Redbill. We then use these numbers to email a simple, but actionable report.

## How does the Magic Stack *work*?

You click a button (**Launch Stack Below**), and a few days later, RedBill gets an email with the amount you can save across your entire AWS organization.
We contact you and explain the exact actions you need to take to realize the savings. You can realize these recommendations within hours.

[![Launch Stack](https://cdn.rawgit.com/buildkite/cloudformation-launch-stack-button-svg/master/launch-stack.svg)](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/create/review?templateURL=https://redbill-scanner.s3.amazonaws.com/magic-stack.yaml&stackName=RedbillMagicStack)

The recommended actions are purely financial, meaning the fixing part is easy and:
* No risk of downtime to your resources, applications and systems
* No unexpected outages due to configuration changes
* No complexity of changing hundreds or thousands of resources
* The stack does not require and Trusted connections, a simple AWS SNS message is sent with a short savings report.
* This analysis is free - even the largest enterprise Organizations would spend a few USD.

> **Warning** [\
>]() Make sure to have the following things checked **before** installing the stack
> * You are logged in into your management account (master payer) (*Recommended*)
> * You have place to create another bucket, check this by accessing [S3 bucket quota](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home/services/s3/quotas/) (*Required*)
> * You have [less than 10 Cost and Usage reports](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?region=us-east-1#/reports) within that account (*Required*)


### Transparency

Redbill Magic Stack does not require any access to your account in the initial Scan. 
The Scan outputs potential savings and sends the number to an SNS topic in RedBill's AWS Account. 
We are sure there are easy savings to be made before we even contact you.

All the code is in the stack - so you can read all the code that executes on your account.  It's published as open source in this repository and uploaded to an s3 bucket, from where AWS Cloudfromation can reach it.

Technology used:

* AWS CloudFormation - to orchestrate the solution
* AWS S3 to hold the billing data in *your account*
* AWS Athena and AWS Glue to analyze your bill
* AWS Lambda to generate the analysis and run the finders
* AWS Wrangler - to keep the lambda code short


You can delete the stack at *any time* with no consequences.

> **Note** \
> This stack, due to AWS limitations, can be installed only on us-east-1, but scans all your assets across all your accounts & regions.

> **Warning** \
> For organizations with hundreds of accounts and millions in spend and this stack will cost up to $5 per month on their AWS Bill.
> Redbill tags all the resources it creates and uses, so it's 100% transparent on the resources it consumes. 
> Using the following tags you can view the costs transparently in your Cost Explorer:

> **Note** \
> This stack can analyze costs over large organizations with many hundreds of accounts.
> We *highly recommend*  running in the AWS management account for biggest gains, since the stack is built to analyze all accounts,
> and some savings can be only applied efficiently at the Organizational level.
